You are given P&L (profit and loss) responsibility of a 
segment at Ruby Card Finance Limited. 
This is like a CEO position.
The company issues credit cards to blue collar workers 
(like Swiggy delivery boys), SME business owners 
(like a shop keeper) etc. 
The segment you are given control of is called 
‘Good bureau high volume transactors’.
However, there is a problem - 
You can see that month on month your loss rates are 
creeping up in this segment by annualized 100 basis points 
, and you need to turn around the profitability of this 
segment in the next three months. 

- Q1. Make a detailed proposal on how you will solve 
this. Do industry research (or read reports) for the 
same. Please link/cite the reports you have read to make 
this proposal 

- Q2. SUPER IMPORTANT - List down ALL the questions 
that you need answers for to successfully craft a 
strategy to increase profitability of this segment. 
Think of the questions in two ways 
1) you are asking these questions to customers 
2) you are asking this questions to Google (for self research).
